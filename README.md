Working with Unix Processes - Book examples
===========================================

Examples and source code from the book [Working with Unix processes](http://pragprog.com/book/jsunix/working-with-unix-processes "Link to the boook")

The examples of the book are made in Ruby but I have ported them to Python.
Also I have included some examples of working with sockets in C from the article
[An Introductory 4.3BSD Interprocess Communication Tutorial](http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/20.ipctut/paper.pdf)
